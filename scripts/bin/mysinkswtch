# Removing pulseaudio means removing pacmd, so this is an attempt at switching the default via pactl instead.
# It successfully sets the default - BUT it appears my programs don't go to that default for some reason?

# Unlike the other scripts where sinks are specified, this just switches between whatever sinks exist.
# Sinks can be specified by name or index. Index changes sometimes when you disconnect and reconnect, restart or whatever, so names are better.
# Annoyingly the command used to switch audio over to a new sink cannot take a name as its argument, otherwise I'd only need the name here.

# Names, which unlike indexes, are persistent

# TODO: Trigger a zenity or dmenu dialog with entr that asks whether to switch monitor and/or sound to hdmi? Could do
# the same for mounting.
